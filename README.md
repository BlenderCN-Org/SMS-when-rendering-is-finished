Receive an SMS on your phone when your render is done

Receiving a SMS when my renders are finished is something important for my workflow because I spend most of my time on the sofa, watching TV while Blender is rendering. This addon gives me a semblance of justification.

I discovered that my phone operator offers a SMS notification service which let you send a message to yourself using a simple HTTP request. I saw a lot of free services like this on the net (search SMS API for instance). 


The line begining by "x = ..." should be changed to match your operator server adress, protocol, credentials...
